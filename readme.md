# eval_model_classifier_image_stability_wpgeb

## Abstract

This is an AIT of simplified (revised) WP-GEB-Estimator-2, 
designed to estimates weight-perturbed generalization bounds. 
It can be used for evaluating the statistically certified stability 
of neural classifiers. The definition of the
weight-perturbed generalization bound and the meaning of
AIT parameters (options)
are explained in the manual of WP-GEB-Estimator-2 and
the manual can be downloaded from [the web-site of WP-GEB-Estimator](https://staff.aist.go.jp/y-isobe/wp-geb-estimator/). Small datasets and models (classifers) for demonstration of this AIT
can be found in the directory '[invenory](https://github.com/yoshinao-isobe/eval_model_classifier_image_stability_wpgeb/tree/main/local_qai/inventory)'.

AIT (AI Test package) is a standardized software package 
used in [Qunomon](https://aistairc.github.io/qunomon/index_en.html) for assessing AI quality. 
Qunomon is a flexible framework designed for the
quality evaluation of machine learning components.
